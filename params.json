It was scaled back to a generic framework, included into Geon's fork of [rest-python](http://github.com/geontech/rest-python/) as `client`, and then heavily modified to match the ongoing development of new interfaces and features found in that fork.\r\n\r\nSo, after months of development and inclusion in other projects, the client framework is being spun off into its own repository (this one) for independent development.  Stay tuned!\r\n","google":"UA-50975337-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
