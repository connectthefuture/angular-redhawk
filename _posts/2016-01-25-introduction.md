Welcome to the long-overdue (yet somewhat early) release of Angular-REDHAWK, which compliments our heavily modified version of [rest-python](http://geontech.github.io/rest-python).  We've been using and improving these two frameworks for a little over a year now, so it's about time they saw the light of day.

Be sure to subscribe to the posts feed or `watch` the repository for updates.  Over time, more directives will be added to the mix to make assembling UIs that much easier.  For now we have a handful of examples that are detailed here along with discussions of how the framework is pieced together.
